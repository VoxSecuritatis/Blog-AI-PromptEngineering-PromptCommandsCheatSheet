## üîí Notes and Best Practices

- Commands should be placed **at the top of your prompt** for clarity.  
- Each command can be combined in a single prompt (ChatGPT interprets them in sequence).  
- Always specify the **objective** and **context** to improve accuracy.  
- Use `temperature=0.2` for analytical or compliance work and `temperature=1.0+` for brainstorming or storytelling.
